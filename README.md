ACET Suite or Assetto Corsa Encryption Tools is a set of blender scripts to assist in working with Encrypted models. 

Assetto Corsa Encryption Tools and ACUtil Shader can both be ran as standalone scripts, however they are both packaged as they use similar code for particular pieces.

This is not entirely an all in one tool, but is as close as could be. It does require additional third party programs to work correctly. 

This is not enteded for public release or use, but more a personal project.

Currently supporting Blender 3.6 LTS as well as Blender 4.2 LTS as of the latest release.
